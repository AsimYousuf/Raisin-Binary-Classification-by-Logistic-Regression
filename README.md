This is a Logistic Regression mini project which classifies raisins into two classes 'Kecimen' and 'Besni'.
The CSV has 900 data points with 6 other input features and target feature class.
The logistic regression algorithm wasn't developed from scratch but imported from popular Python library Scikit Learn.
The test accuracy was about 87 % and very hard to improve because of the small size of the dataset.
